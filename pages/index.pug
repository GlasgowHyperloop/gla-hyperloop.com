              h3 About Hyperloop
              | A futuristic transportation initially proposed by Elon Musk, CEO of Space X and Tesla. Hyperloop utilizes magnetic levitation in a near vacuum chamber to accelerate objects to high speeds. Within this vessel, passengers can be whisked through linked tunnels at up to 700 mph or 1,200 kmh.
              br
              | This would mean travelling the space of Glasgow to London within 45 minutes.

              | Space X holds an annual Hyperloop Pod competition in California to accelerate the development of this technology and to encourage innovation. Students need to design and build a half-scale pod that can be self-propelled through a 1.2 km pressurised tube.
              br
              | This yearâ€™s competition focuses on maximum speed with successful deceleration.
